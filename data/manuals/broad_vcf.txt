broad_vcf - Analysis of sequins variants (.vcf) in human whole genome sequencing workflow.

<b>USAGE EXAMPLE:</b>
$ anaquin broad_vcf -v merged.vcf

<b>OPTIONS:</b>
    Required
        -v/--vcf                        Variant calls (.VCF) from sequin alignments to decoy chromosome (chrQ).
    
    Optional
        -o/--output                     Directory to write output files to (default = output).
        -r/--resource_dir               Directory containing resource files (default = resources).

<b>OUTPUTS</b>
    anaquin.log                             
    report_vcf.txt                      Summary statistics describing sequencing and alignment performance.
    sequins.vcf                         Annotation of all variants found on the decoy chromosome (no sample variants).

<b>NOTE:</b>
The broad_vcf tool is the second step in the analysis of sequins in human WGS (first step uses broad_bam). The broad_bam tool will:
a. Accept a .VCF file containing variants called from alignments to the decoy chromsome (chrQ). 
b. Variants should be called from a calibrated .BAM file (produced using broad_bam) to ensure that sequins alignment coverage is matched to corresponding human regions.
c. Provide an output report with library details (including diagnostic performance).<<@@@@>>
