somatic - Analysis of synthetic somatic variants on decoy chromsome (chrQ*).

<b>USAGE EXAMPLE:</b>
$ anaquin somatic -v variants.vcf

<b>OPTIONS:</b>
        -v/--vcf                        Variants (.VCF) called from sequin alignments to decoy chromosomes (.VCF may also include sample variants).
        -o/--output                     Directory to write output files to (default = output).
        -r/--resource_dir               Directory containing resource files (default = resources).
        --edge                          Size (nt) of sequin terminal regions which should be ignored when assessing performance to avoid impact of
                                        sequencing edge-effects (default = 550).
        --restrict_regions              Supply custom annotation file (.BED) containing regions of interest in the human genome (e.g. gene panel targets).
                                        Anaquin will limit analysis to the intersection of these regions with the sequin regions.       
        --vcf_hg38                      Sequin variant file (.VCF) generated from sequin reads that have been mirrored (using split) and aligned to the
                                        human genome (e.g. hg38). Use with --sample_variants.  

<b>OUTPUTS</b>
        anaquin.log                     Log file of anaquin processes.  
        somatic_report.txt              Summary statistics describing sequencing and alignment performance.
        sequins_TP.vcf                  True positives of all variants found on the decoy chromosome (no sample variants).
        sequins_FP.vcf                  False positives of all variants found on the decoy chromosome (no sample variants).
        sequins_FN.vcf                  False negatives of all variants found on the decoy chromosome (no sample variants).<<@@@@>>
