calibrate - Calibration and analysis of sequins alignments (.bam) in human whole genome sequencing workflow.

<b>USAGE EXAMPLE:</b>
$ anaquin calibrate -b alignments.bam

<b>OPTIONS:</b>
        -b/--bam                        Alignment file (.BAM) to combined index comprising both human genome (hg38) and decoy chromosomes (chrQ*).
        -o/--output                     Directory to write output files to (default = output).
        -r/--resource_dir               Directory containing resource files (default = resources).
        --calibration_method            Calibration method (default = mean). Possible values are "mean", "custom".
                                        
                                        Example usage of custom calibration method:
                                        
                                        anaquin calibrate ... --calibration_method custom --custom_sequin_threshold 30 ...
                                        
                                        The usage will allow Anaquin to calibrate sequin coverage to its corresponding sample if:
                                        
                                        - The sequin coverage is higher than the sample coverage
                                        - The sample coverage is higher than 30
        
                                        Otherwise, Anaquin will calibrate sequin coverage to global sample median.
                                        
                                        For example, let's assume the global sample median (over all sequin regions) is 30.
                                        
                                        Case 1: sequin coverage = 100 and sample coverage = 1                                        
                                                Anaquin will calibrate sequins to 30 (otherwise sequin reads will be lost if calibrating to 1).

                                        Case 2: sequin coverage = 100 and sample coverage = 50                                        
                                                Anaquin will calibrate sequins to 50.
        --sequin_alignment              Provide sequin alignment file (.BAM) that has been generated from sequin reads that have been mirrored (using split)
                                        and then aligned to the human genome (e.g. hg38). Use with --sample_alignments option.
        --sample_alignment              Provide sample alignments file (.BAM) that are generated from sample reads aligned to the human genome (e.g. hg38).
                                        Use with --sequin_alignments option. 
        --sample_bam                    Output a .BAM file containing sample alignments only.
        --sequin_bam                    Output a .BAM file containing sequin alignments only.
        --calibrated_sequin_bam         Output the calibrated .BAM file of sequin alignments.
        --restrict_regions              Restrict calibration to custom regions (.BED) of interest in the human genome (e.g. gene panel targets).
                                        Anaquin will limit analysis to the intersection of these regions with the sequin regions.
