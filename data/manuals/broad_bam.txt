broad_bam - Calibration and analysis of sequins alignments (.bam) in human whole genome sequencing workflow.

<b>USAGE EXAMPLE:</b>
$ anaquin broad_bam -b sample.bam

<b>OPTIONS:</b>
    Required
        -b/--bam                        Alignments to co-index of human genome (hg38) and decoy chromosome (chrQ).
    
    Optional
        -o/--output                     Directory to write output files to (default = output).
        -r/--resource_dir               Directory containing resource files (default = resources).
        --dilution                      Calibrate sequin alignments to specified count (eg 10000) or fraction (eg 0.01).
                                        (default = sequins coverage is calibrated to match coverage of corresponding human genome.

<b>OUTPUTS</b>
    anaquin.log                             
    report_bam.txt                      Summary statistics describing sequencing and alignment performance.
    merged.bam                          Alignment file comprising both sample and (calibrated) sequin alignment.
    sequins.bam                         Sequin-derived alignments (.BAM) to the decoy chromosome (no sample alignments).    
    calibrated.bam                      Sequin-derived alignments that have been calibrated to match the coverage of corresponding human genome regions.

<b>NOTE:</b>
The broad_bam tool is the first step in the analysis of sequins in human WGS (second step uses broad_vcf). The broad_bam tool will:
a. Accept a .BAM file containing human alignments (to hg38) as well as sequin alignments (to chrQ).
b. Calibrate sequins alignment coverage (to chrQ) to match coverage corresponding human of corresponding human genome regions.
c. The output calibrated .BAM file is then used as per normal in downstream variant-calling steps.
d. Provide an output report with library details (including sequencing error, quantitative accuracy and copy-number variation).<<@@@@>>
