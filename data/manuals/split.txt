split - Partition a NGS library (.FASTQ) file into two libraries: reads from sequins and reads from the accompanying (human) sample. Sequin reads will be reversed, so they match the orientation of the human reference genome. Also reports on sequin performance in NGS library.

<b>TOOL OPTIONS:</b>
    Required:
        -1                              Input FASTQ file (first pair)
        -2                              Input FASTQ file (second pair)
    Or:
        -b/--combined                   Input BAM file containing sample and sequin alignments.
                                        Sequin reads must be aligned to the sequin decoy chromosomes (chrQ).
    Optional:
        -o/--output                     Directory to which output files are written (default = output).
        -t/--threads                    Number of threads used (default = 1).
        --threshold                     Minimum fraction of kmers required to classify read as sequin-derived (default = 0.2).
        --kmer                          K-mer length (default = 23).
        --skip                          Assess every nth k-mer in read. Skipping more k-mers allows faster computation (default = 5).
        -r/--resource_dir               Directory containing resource files (default = resources).
        --manual_fasta                  Supply custom sequence catalog (.FASTA; instead of using default sequin sequence catalog).
        --calibrate                     Calibrate sequin alignments to specified count (eg 10000) or fraction (eg 0.01). Useful for comparing between samples or replicates.
        --ladder_calibrate              Calibrate synthetic ladder alignments to specified count (eg 10000) or fraction (eg 0.01).

<b>USAGE EXAMPLE:</b>
    To split a paired-end FASTQ library:
    $ anaquin split -1 sample_with_sequins.1.fq -2 sample_with_sequins.2.fq

    To split a BAM alignment file:
    $ anaquin split --combined sample_with_sequins.bam
