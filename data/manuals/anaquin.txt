       <tool>
            Execute the following data analysis tool:

            rna           - Used for analysis of rna sequins within an RNAseq library. This includes partitioning sequins  reads from the accompanying sample,
                            and reporting on sequin performance.
            meta          - Used for analysis of metagenome sequins within an NGS library. This includes partitioning sequins reads from the accompanying sample,
                            and reporting on sequin performance.
            split         - For use with genomics sequins. Partition a NGS library (.FASTQ) file into two libraries: reads from sequins and reads from the accompanying
                            (human) sample. Also reports on sequin performance in NGS library. 
            calibrate     - Sequin alignments are subsampled to match the alignment coverage of the accompanying (human) sample (genome sequins only).
            cancer        - Sequin alignments are subsampled to match the alignment coverage of the accompanying (human) sample (somatic sequins only).
            germline      - Assess the detection of germline variants in sequins and sample (genome sequins only).   
            somatic       - Assess the detection of somatic variants in sequins and sample (genome sequins only).
